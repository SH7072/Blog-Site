      "body": "To rank up in Valorant, you will need to start getting kills, assist your allies and make tactical use of your abilities. As you start to progress, you will need to focus on winning matches and strategizing with your squad. As soon as you get placed, you should focus all your attention on team cooperation and strategizing for quick progression and climbing the ranks. Also when you are fresh in your Valorant competitive career, you need to keep a track of your average combat score which impacts your overall efficiency as you progress. One may also experiment with a number of different agents available in the game and decide which one best suits their playstyle.On the other hand, if you are constantly losing matches or giving bad performances in competitive, your rank will ultimately go down. You should also note that the game tracks your rank inactivity.This means that if you donâ€™t enter competitive matches up to 14 days, Valorant considers your account inactive, thereby hiding your rank.",
